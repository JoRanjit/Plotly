# Belly Button bio diversity project using Plotly
### For this project, people wiped cotton swabs in or on their belly buttons. Each participantâ€™s belly button hosted about 67 different species of microbes. Yet not one was common to every person, and only eight were found on at least 70 percent of participants.
#### This Plotly project helps to dive into the research using charts and figures.

##### We created a drop down option where the user could choose from the many samples listed. Based on the selection - charts will be updated with the results of the research like:
    * details of the subject from whom the sample was taken
    * a Plotly horizontal bar chart with the IDs of the microbes found in his belly button and their counts.
        -- IDs of the microbes(otu-id) on y-axis
        -- count of microbes(sample values) on x-axis
        -- the microbe names(otu-labels) on hover-over

##### A bubble chart is generated which also gives a different view of the IDs and counts and types of microbes found on the subject's belly button.
    * we used Plotly's 'scatter' chart option to create this graph,
        -- otu-ids on x-axis
        -- sample values as y-axis
        -- sample values as size of the bubbles
        -- otu-ids as marker colors(using the 'Earth' color-scale)     
        -- otu-lables as hover text

#### A gauge chart which showed the wash frequency of the subject per week is also provided
    * we used Plotly's 'gauge' chart option to create this chart
        -- used 'indicator' chart type with the wash frequency as value  
        -- mode is 'gauge+number'
        -- used five steps from 0-2 up-to 8-10 with 10 as max. with 5 different colors.
        -- bar color of gauge is set to black

#### Finally we created a github webpage to host this website - https://joranjit.github.io/Plotly/
    * formatted the sheet using style.css stylesheet
        -- added an image to the jumbotron title bar
        -- added more information about the project as a paragraph
        -- added different back-ground colors to different sections
        -- re-organized the charts and sections to create a better look.
